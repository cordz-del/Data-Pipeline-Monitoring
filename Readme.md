# Data Pipeline & Monitoring Repository

This repository focuses on building a robust, real-time data pipeline combined with continuous monitoring and logging. It demonstrates how to ingest, clean, and store large volumes of security or operational data, and then seamlessly integrate these data flows with AI components to enhance security insights and overall system reliability.

## Overview

The Data Pipeline & Monitoring Repository is designed to showcase end-to-end skills in managing data pipelines and monitoring production systems. The project focuses on:
- **Data Ingestion & Processing:** Techniques for ingesting, cleaning, and storing large volumes of data in real time.
- **Real-Time Logging & Monitoring:** Implementation of continuous monitoring and logging using cloud-native tools (e.g., AWS CloudWatch, Prometheus, or Grafana) to track system performance and detect anomalies.
- **Integration with Existing Systems:** How these data flows feed into AI components to improve security insights and system reliability.

## Features

- **Data Ingestion & Processing:**  
  - Ingest real-time security and operational data.
  - Clean and preprocess the data for further analysis.
  - Store the processed data in a database or data lake.

- **Real-Time Logging & Monitoring:**  
  - Continuous monitoring of system metrics and logs.
  - Integration with cloud-native tools for performance tracking and anomaly detection.
  - Custom dashboards for visualizing key metrics.

- **System Integration:**  
  - Seamless integration of processed data with AI components.
  - Enhanced security insights through enriched data flows.
  - Scalable architecture designed for production-grade workloads.

## Architecture

The system is composed of three main layers:
1. **Data Ingestion Layer:**  
   Collects raw data from various sources, cleans it, and stores it in a structured format.
2. **Monitoring & Logging Layer:**  
   Uses cloud-native tools and custom scripts to continuously monitor system performance and log events.
3. **Integration Layer:**  
   Feeds processed data into AI modules (for example, anomaly detection or incident response systems) to improve the decision-making process.

A high-level architectural diagram (see `docs/architecture.md`) details the interaction between these layers.
